## How to run
Download all the code, unzip, and open either `ui.R`, `server.R`, or `global.R`.

Make sure all packages are installed. Then run the app with `shiny::runApp('gsrs-dashboard-main')` (or whatever your folder name is). Alternatively, open one of the R files in RShiny and "Run App" under the External option.
